# Perplexity Hackathon Submission: 

## Abstract
*This project introduces (Name), a web app that provides visual traffic data and contextualizes this data by integrating Sonar by Perplexity AI. Designed with the daily commuter’s safety in mind, we combine real-time and historical traffic data with artificial intelligence to provide a dynamic exploration of traffic conditions statewide.*

*By using the interactive map, users can examine when and where incidents occur down to specific hours and the towns an incident occurred in. The application uses the HERE API to supply up-to-date traffic incidents. Upon request, an incident is then enriched with contextual insights through Perplexity’s Sonar API, allowing users to quickly understand causes, trends, and contributing factors. A free-form question interface further enables natural language queries about regional traffic safety, construction patterns, and time-specific spikes.*

*This project aims to leverage geospatial analytics, real-time APIs, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) tools to serve as both a commuting assistant and a public safety research tool. We offer a scalable model for an AI-derived application to transportation planning, civic technology, and smart city development, while remaining cost-effective and user-focused.*
